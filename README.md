# Diabetes-Symptom-Analysis-and-Prediction
Analyze diabetes-related symptoms using healthcare data to visualize symptom prevalence, rank feature importance, and predict diabetes risk with machine learning. Includes an interactive dashboard to explore insights dynamically.

## **Project Overview**
This project leverages healthcare data to analyze diabetes-related symptoms, predict diabetes risk, and provide interactive visualizations. Key features include:
1. **Symptom Prevalence Analysis**: Visualize frequencies of symptoms in diabetic vs. non-diabetic individuals.
2. **Feature Importance Ranking**: Use machine learning (Random Forest) to rank symptoms based on predictive importance.
3. **Interactive Dashboard**: Built with Dash and Plotly, allows filtering by gender and exploring symptom prevalence dynamically.

## **Dataset**
The dataset used is publicly available on Kaggle: [Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishandutta/early-stage-diabetes-risk-prediction-dataset?resource=download). It contains information about symptoms, gender, age, and diabetes classification (Positive/Negative).
